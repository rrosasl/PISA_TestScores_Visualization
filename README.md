## About the data

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. of the dataset to be presented here.

This dataset contains > 500k rows of data and >600 columns, which means it is a

## Main Findings
- Test results are normally distributed and are similar across reading, maths, and science, 
- Oceania is the continent with the highest average scores
- Singapore is the country with the most students in the top 50
- Those who strongly agree that doing well is completely up to me do not perform significantly better than those who do not
